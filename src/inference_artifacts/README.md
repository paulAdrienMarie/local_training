# Folder for the inference artifacts

In this folder please download the correct onnx model file from the following url : https://huggingface.co/Xenova/vit-base-patch16-224/tree/main/onnx.

Rename it: `inference_onnx`.

Copy past it to have it twice, one will be used to generate the training artifacts and another one will be updated by training it locally.

Rename it: `initial_model.onnx`
